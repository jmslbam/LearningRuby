# Questions about Ruby

## Week 1
- Why include `require 'rubygems'`   
Because of the version. 1.8 needs the crowngems ;)

- `&&` and `'and'`  
Could you explain a bit more about the difference of && and 'and'

# `@`  
What is the `@`?
I think `@` is a variable with a scope so you can use it in other mehthods.
