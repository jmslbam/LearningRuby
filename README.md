# Learning Ruby

Code when learning Ruby.  
All code is homebrewn on Windows XP. Installation was peace of cake. Not a lie ;)  

# Questions about Ruby
- Why include `require 'rubygems'`  

- `&&` and `'and'`  
Could you explain a bit more about the difference of && and 'and'

- `@`  
#What is the `@`?
I think `@` is a variable with a scope so you can use it in other mehthods.
